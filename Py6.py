#The following table lists an octave of music notes, beginning with middle A, along with their frequencies.
#Note Frequency (Hz)
#A4 440.00
#Begin by writing a program that reads the name of a note from the user and displays the notes frequency. Your program should support all of the notes listed previously.
#Once you have your program working correctly for the notes listed previously you should add support for all of the notes from A0 to A8.
#While this could be done by adding many additional cases to your if statement, such a solution is cumbersome,
#inelegant and unacceptable for the purposes of this exercise. Instead, you should exploit the relationship between notes in adjacent octaves. In particular, the frequency of any note in octave n is half the frequency of the corresponding note in octave n+1.
#By using this relationship, you should be able to add support for the additional notes without adding additional cases to your if statement.
#Hint: To complete this exercise you will need to extract individual characters from the two-character note name so that you can work with the letter and the octave number separately.
#Once you have separated the parts, compute the frequency of the note in the fourth octave using the data in the table above.
#Then divide the frequency by 2 power(4-x ), where x is the octave number entered by the user. This will halve or double the frequency the correct number of times.
#Then divide the frequency by 2 power(4-x ), where x is the octave number entered by the user. (freq=freq/2**(4-octave))
